# SistorFixor

This is my really cool puzzle prototype where you fix logic gates! Yay!

This is _NOT_ meant to be comprehensive or accurate to real-life, though I will
try my best :)

The project is inspired by Sebastian Lague's DLS (Digital Logic Sim), though
there is not the same focus on accuracy and is more focused on problem solving,
rather than diagramming and simulating.

## Features

- Fundamental Logic Pieces
  - NAND, NOR, I/O
- Common Logic Pieces
  - AND, OR, XOR
- Simplistic serialisation
- Puzzles!
- NO Clocks!

And that's it!
